# Spring Boot Testing Repository

Welcome to the Spring Boot Testing repository! This repository is designed to provide examples and resources for implementing testing strategies using JUnit, Mockito, and following Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices with Spring Boot applications.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find code examples and explanations related to Spring Boot testing, with a focus on utilizing JUnit and Mockito for effective unit and integration testing. Additionally, we explore Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a methodology to guide our development process through writing tests first.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, make sure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-Darwish/spring-boot-testing.git
cd spring-boot-testing
```

## Testing Frameworks

We make use of the following testing frameworks in this repository:

- **JUnit:** A popular Java testing framework for writing and running unit tests.
- **Mockito:** A mocking framework for creating mock objects in unit tests.
- **Spring Boot Test:** Provides support for writing tests for Spring Boot applications.

## TDD Process

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. The TDD process typically involves the following steps:

1. Write a Failing Test: Begin by writing a test for the desired functionality. This test should initially fail since the functionality hasn't been implemented yet.
2. Write the Code: Implement the code necessary to make the test pass. Don't worry about optimization at this stage.
3. Refactor: Once the test passes, refactor the code while ensuring that all tests continue to pass.

## Examples

You'll find various examples in the [examples](examples/) directory showcasing how to write unit tests and integration tests for different components of a Spring Boot application using JUnit and Mockito. Each example includes a step-by-step explanation of the TDD process.
